   title: Optimizing Mass Transit Bus Routes with Big Data
   abstract: Big data analytics is important in the public bus transportation domain because optimized public bus systems can reduce congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, while offering a safe, affordable, and convenient way to travel; however, in many cities people prefer to take private transportation over public buses. Big data can help bridge this gap by optimizing the three pillars of public bus transportation: routes, schedules and infrastructure.
