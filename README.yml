        Big data analytics is important in the public bus transportation domain
        because optimized public bus systems can reduce congestion and greenhouse
        gas emissions, while offering a safe, affordable, and convenient way to travel;
        however, in many cities people prefer to take private transportation over
        public buses. Big data can help bridge this gap by optimizing the three pillars
        of public bus transportation: routes, schedules and infrastructure.

        Like the internet in the 1980s and early 1990s, blockchain is a grossly misunderstood technology
        that has the capability of transforming a wide variety of industries. These industries extend 
        beyond just financial transactions and cryptocurrencies and includes healthcare and supply chain.
        This paper reviews the history and current status of blockchain and investigates use cases for 
        how blockchain can transform healthcare and supply chain.
