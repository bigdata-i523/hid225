        Optimized public bus networks reduce greenhouse gases while providing a safe and affordable way to travel. Fighting against an unglamorous reputation and stereotypes of inconvenience, modern bus networks must continually update their routes and schedules to meet the demands of modern commuters. Fortunately, big data analytical methods can identify optimal routes through human mobility mining and optimize schedules through dynamic coordinating bus clusters, station and interstation controls. These methods make it more possible than ever to offer a dynamic and convenient public bus network. Fully optimized public bus systems have the potential to increase quality of life standards, catalyze new development, and prevent urban sprawl.

        Like TCP/IP in the 1970s and 1980s, blockchain is a new, intriguing but grossly misunderstood technology that is still in its infancy. It is commonly misunderstood as just a technology for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. However, blockchain's use cases extend beyond just financial transactions and cryptocurrencies and have the potential to transform nearly every industry including healthcare and supply chain. As the technology matures, additional transformative use cases could expand into drug distribution; specifically, a blockchain system for prescription opioid distribution could theoretically mitigate some aspects of the opioid crisis.
