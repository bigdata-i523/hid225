        Big data analytics is important in the public bus transportation domain
        because optimized public bus systems can reduce congestion and greenhouse
        gas emissions, while offering a safe, affordable, and convenient way to travel;
        however, in many cities people prefer to take private transportation over
        public buses. Big data can help bridge this gap by optimizing the three pillars
        of public bus transportation: routes, schedules and infrastructure.
