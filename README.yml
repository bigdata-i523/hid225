        Optimized public bus networks reduce greenhouse gases while providing a safe and affordable way to travel. Fighting against an unglamorous reputation and stereotypes of inconvenience, modern bus networks must continually update their routes and schedules to meet the demands of modern commuters. Fortunately, big data analytical methods can identify optimal routes through human mobility mining and optimize schedules through dynamic coordinating bus clusters, station and interstation controls. These methods make it more possible than ever to offer a dynamic and convenient public bus network. Fully optimized public bus systems have the potential to increase quality of life standards, catalyze new development, and prevent urban sprawl.

        Like the internet in the 1980s and early 1990s, blockchain is a grossly misunderstood technology
        that has the capability of transforming a wide variety of industries. These industries extend 
        beyond just financial transactions and cryptocurrencies and includes healthcare and supply chain.
        This paper reviews the history and current status of blockchain and investigates use cases for 
        how blockchain can transform healthcare and supply chain.
